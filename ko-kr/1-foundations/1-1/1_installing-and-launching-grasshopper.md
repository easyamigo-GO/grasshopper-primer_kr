# 1.1.1. 그래스호퍼 설치 및 실행

## <mark style="color:$primary;">1.1.1. 그래스호퍼 설치 및 실행</mark>

_**(역자 주: 라이노 6 이후 버전부터는 그래스호퍼가 기본 내장되어 있어 별도 설치가 필요 없습니다.)**_

~~그래스호퍼 플러그인은 자주 업데이트되므로 항상 최신 빌드로 업데이트하는 것이 좋습니다~~

~~참고로 현재 맥용 Grasshopper 버전은 없습니다.~~

~~1.1.1.1. DOWNLOADING To download the Grasshopper plug-in, visit the Grasshopper web site. Click on the Download tab at the top of the page, and when prompted on the next screen, enter your email address. Now, right click on the download link, and choose Save Target As from the menu. Select a location on your hard drive (note: the file cannot be loaded over a network connection, so the file must be saved locally to your computer’s hard drive) and save the executable file to that address.~~

> Download Grasshopper from the [grasshopper3d.com](http://grasshopper3d.com) website.

~~1.1.1.2. INSTALLING Select Run from the download dialog box follow the installer instructions. (note: you must have Rhino 5 already installed on your computer for the plug-in to install properly).~~

> Follow the steps in the Installation wizard.

~~1.1.1.3. LAUNCHING To Launch Grasshopper, type Grasshopper into the Rhino Command line. When you launch Grasshopper, the first thing you will see is a new window floating in front of Rhino. Within this window you can create node-based programs to automate various types of functionality in Rhino. Best practice is to arrange the windows so that they do not overlap and Grasshopper does not obstruct the Rhino viewports.~~

> ~~Split the screen so that Grasshopper does not obstruct the Rhino Viewports. You can do this by dragging each window to opposite sides of the screen, or by holding the Wondows key and pressing the left or right arrows.~~
